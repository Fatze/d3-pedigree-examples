# d3-pedigree-examples

Examples of how to create family pedigrees with [D3](http://d3js.org/). When I
started learning how to draw pedigrees with D3, I had difficulty mixing and matching
techniques from different examples and separating the basics from the fancy 
stylistic additions. Hopefully by showing the basics and how to incrementally add
advanced features, you won't have to become an expert in D3 just to draw a pedigree.
